This is a course project for Point Process and Its Application(CS488), ACM Class 2017, SJTU. Written in 2020.

## Introduction
This assignment has two task. The first one is to use thinning algorithm to simulate multi-dimensional hawkes process and the second is to use ADMM-MM (ADM4) algorithm to build a multi-dimensional hawkes model based on a real-world dataset of more than 1,000 automated teller machines (ATMs) from a global bank headquartered in North America, and predict when a machine encounters an error and what the error is.
